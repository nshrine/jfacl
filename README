		JFACL 0.3.1

About
=====
jfacl is a GUI for editing Solaris Access Control Lists (ACLS) and is 
intended to be an easy alternative to the Solaris getfacl/setfacl 
commmands, primarily for Windows users hence the look.

Licence
=======
See the file COPYING

Requirements
============
Solaris 7 upwards
Java 2 Runtime 1.4.0 upwards

For rebuilding:
Java 2 SDK 1.4.0 upwards
Jakarta Ant 1.4.1 upwards (http://ant.apache.org)
gcc 2.95.3 (untested with later versions)

Installation
============
Edit the jfacl script and set JAVA_HOME to point to your
java installation and BASE to the directory in which you unpacked jfacl.
Add BASE to your path then run jfacl as:

	jfacl <file or dir> [[<file or dir>]...]


Rebuilding
==========
In the directory src do:
make (you need ant in your path)
make install (installs lib/libjacl.so and jfacl.jar)

Bugs/Issues
===========
Java so it runs slow! On a system with lots of users the
"Select Users or Groups" dialog can take a few seconds to appear
whilst the list is sorted alphabetically: on our system with over
1000 users and groups it takes 10-15 secs on a 360 Mhz Ultra 5.

Please report any bugs/suggestions to Nick Shrine
