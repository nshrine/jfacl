		JFACL 0.4.2

About
=====
jfacl is a GUI for editing Linux and Solaris file Access Control Lists (ACLS)
and is intended to be an easy alternative to the Solaris getfacl/setfacl
commmands.

Licence
=======
See the file doc/COPYING

Requirements
============
Solaris 7 upwards or Linux 2.4 upwards.
Java JRE 5.0

LINUX NOTE: ACLs need to be enabled in the kernel and local filesystems need
to be mounted with the "acl" option (NFS filesystems need acls enabled)
otherwise Jfacl will simply act as a chmod GUI. 
See here http://acl.bestbits.at/ for information on Linux ACLs.

For rebuilding:
Java SDK 5.0
Jakarta Ant 1.4.1 upwards (http://ant.apache.org)
GCC for the native code

Installation
============
See the file INSTALL

Rebuilding
==========
In the src directory do:
make -f Makefile.linux (you need ant in your path)
make -f Makefile.linux install (installs lib/$(KERNEL)/$(PROCESSOR)/libjacl.so
	and lib/jfacl.jar)
Replace Makefile.linux with Makefile.solaris for Solaris.

Release History
===============
