(rel. 0.4.2) 23/1/2006 - Fix for startup script for new uname in GNU
	coreutils.

(rel. 0.4.1) 18/1/2006 - Added a dialog to enter user/group names manually.
        Ported some code to Java 5.0 (added generics, foreach, static imports).
        Added THEME setting to startup script; default is old Java 'steel'
        theme.

(rel. 0.4b) 2/12/2005 - First Linux version. Licence is now GPL. Removed
	SwingWorker class.
	
(rel. 0.3.1) 16/2/2004 - Speed-up patch from Daniel Fahlgren. Removed
	unecessary getname native function as real names are loaded into
	UfsAclEntry class as the user list is constructed thus cutting out
	uneccessary calls to getpwent/getpwuid when sorting the user/group
	list. Add Dialog now appears much faster for large user/group lists.

(rel. 0.3) 10/2/2004 - Patch supplied by Daniel Fahlgren
	(http://www.cs.umu.se/~fahlgren/) to prevent buffer overflows in
	C code, to display users as "[username] Real Name" and to delimit
	the real name at the first "," character in the passwd entry.

(rel. 0.2.1) 9/2/2004 - Bug fix: "Add Default" button was not being enabled
	in Add dialog when default acl entries were added to acl list due to
	DEFAULTS flag being set on creation of Add dialog and not being 
	updated to reflect changes in acl.

(rel. 0.2) 30/1/2004 - Bug fix: now root is allowed to edit facls that don't
	belong to them. Also changed java package structure.

(rel. 0.2b) 25/7/2003 - Added a progress monitor for when loading names into
	the Add Dialog. Dialog is kept in memory and just made visible when
	required so is faster. Changed all Vectors to ArrayLists to hopefully
	speed things up. Changed the ListSelectionListener code for the main
	ACL list so that something is always selected. Made the UnixPerm class
	neater.

(rel. 0.1.1) 10/7/2003 - Bug fix: change comparator in UfsAclEntry so that 
	it distinguishes between usernames and groups with the same gecos field.
	Previously if they were the same only one would be displayed in the Add
	dialog e.g. user "nobody" and group "nobody".

(rel. 0.1beta) 28/4/2003 - first working version
